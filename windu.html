    windu. not him. not that guy. not that person. not anyone else. i am me. this is windu. pronounced ween-du. a boy. 17 years old as it now.
    as a canvas medium to paint everything i want to. everything i dream to. everything i likes to. from my favorite moments, photos, notes, drawing, all my memories in my life in there. i packed them all here. in this site.
      <p>*a word. if ever we come across to be in the same path or we already are. feel free to ask me everything you want to, good or bad, i will answer it honestly. feel free to give your opinion on me. feel free to articulate those moment we share together.
    the circle continues. our life continues. our dreams is still calling us. it bound to happen. in god i put my faith. 
    love. my regards. thank you.
